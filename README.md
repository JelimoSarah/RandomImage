# Overall Project Description
Write a JavaScript program to display a random image (clicking on a button) from the following list.

"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3691/11268502654_f28f05966c_m.jpg", width: "240", height: "160"
"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/33/45336904_1aef569b30_n.jpg", width: "320", height: "195"
"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5211/5384592886_80a512e2c9.jpg", width: "500", height: "343"

TIP: You might need an array  to solve this.

Further Exploration:
Now use a form to get a user to select the image they want out of the list of images.
Add the image dimensions to each image based on the image that the user selects.
